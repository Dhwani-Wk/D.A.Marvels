      name: 'MARVEL X Metal Framing',
      description: 'Marvel X is made of special high-performance steel that undergoes stringent quality checks and controls to ensure correct and consistent base material for further profiling. The steel comes in rolled coils to maintain the proper thickness throughout its length. Quality checks ensure correct selection of material for strength and corrosion resistance. The steel sheet is work-hardened by passing it through a teethed roller with a design which gives a typical unique pattern on the surface. This pattern along with D.A.MARVEL® Logo embossed on each component are the key identifiers of genuine D.A.MARVEL® metal components. D.A.MARVEL® is manufactured through a cold rolled pre-forming process that locally work-hardens the base material, and provides great strength to the false ceiling and drywall systems.',
